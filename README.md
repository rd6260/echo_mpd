## 🧠 Why This Project?

Existing mobile MPD clients like **MALP** and **MPDroid** are powerful but feel outdated in terms of design and user experience. This project aims to bring a **fresh, responsive, and beautiful** remote control app to the MPD ecosystem, built for everyday use in 2025 and beyond.
